    <h1>Accessibility statement for CIAS</h1>

    <p>
      We want everyone who visits the CIAS website to feel welcome and find the
      experience rewarding.
    </p>

    <h2>What are we doing?</h2>

    <p>
      To help us make the CIAS website a positive place for everyone, we&apos;ve
      been using the{' '}
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
      </a>
      . These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for
      people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA).
      We&apos;ve chosen Level AA as the target for the CIAS website.
    </p>

    <h2>How are we doing?</h2>

    <p>
      We&apos;ve worked hard on the CIAS website and believe we&apos;ve achieved
      our goal of Level AA accessibility. We monitor the website regularly to
      maintain this, but if you do find any problems, please get in touch.
    </p>

    <h2>Let us know what you think</h2>
